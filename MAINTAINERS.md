# Maintainers Guide for PrioLab

This document outlines the responsibilities, processes, and guidelines for PrioLab maintainers. It serves as a reference for current maintainers and provides transparency for the community.

## Current Maintainers

- **Imad Selka** ([@imadselka](https://github.com/imadselka)) - Project Lead
  - Email: imadselka@devoria.me
  - Responsibilities: Overall project direction, architectural decisions, final review of critical changes

- **Community Team**

## Maintainer Responsibilities

### General Responsibilities
- Review and merge pull requests
- Triage and address issues
- Guide contributors
- Enforce the code of conduct
- Make technical decisions when consensus cannot be reached
- Maintain project documentation
- Release management

### Response Times
As volunteers, maintainers strive to respond to issues and pull requests within:
- Initial response to new issues: 2-3 business days
- PR reviews: 3-5 business days
- Code of Conduct violations: 24 hours

## Adding New Maintainers

We believe in growing our maintainer team as the project scales. The process for becoming a maintainer includes:

1. Demonstrated consistent contributions over time (3+ months)
2. Understanding of project architecture and goals
3. Shown good judgment in PR reviews and technical discussions
4. Nomination by an existing maintainer
5. Approval by majority of current maintainers

## Decision Making Process

- **Consensus-seeking approach**: For most decisions, we seek consensus among maintainers
- **PR approvals**: Generally require approval from at least one maintainer (two for critical systems)
- **Major decisions**: Major architectural or directional changes require broader discussion and agreement
- **Conflict resolution**: In cases where consensus cannot be reached, the project lead makes the final decision

## Release Process

1. Version bump according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a GitHub release with detailed release notes
4. Announce on appropriate channels

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

### Receiving Reports
- Reports are received via the contact emails specified in the Code of Conduct
- All reports are treated confidentially
- Reports are acknowledged within 24 hours

### Investigation Process
1. Review the report and gather necessary information
2. Speak separately with all involved parties
3. Consult with other maintainers while maintaining confidentiality
4. Document all interactions and decisions

### Enforcement Actions
Depending on severity and pattern of behavior:

1. **Warning**: Private communication explaining the violation and consequences of continued behavior
2. **Temporary Ban**: Removal from project spaces for a specified time period
3. **Permanent Ban**: Indefinite removal from project spaces

### Appeals Process
Individuals may appeal enforcement actions by emailing the maintainer team with subject "CoC Appeal". Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not involved in the initial decision.

## Project Governance

### Repository Management
- Protected main branch requiring reviews
- Squash merging preferred for cleaner history
- Linear history maintained (no merge commits)

### Issue Management
- Issues are triaged weekly
- Labels are used to track status and type
- Stale issues are closed after 60 days of inactivity

## Stepping Down

If a maintainer needs to reduce involvement or step down:
1. Notify other maintainers with reasonable notice
2. Help identify potential new maintainers if possible
3. Transfer any critical access or knowledge

## Communication

Maintainers communicate through:
- GitHub discussions and issues for public topics
- Private maintainer channel for sensitive discussions
- Monthly maintainer sync meetings

## Amendments to This Document

Changes to this document should be proposed via pull request and require approval from a majority of maintainers.
